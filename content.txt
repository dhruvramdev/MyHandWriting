#[Q1. TRIPS Agreement governs and protect the IPR in global countries, sometimes it critiqued by some situations” – How do you judge this statement? Illustrate with examples.]#(black)

Since TRIPS came into force, it has been subject to criticism from developing countries, academics, and non-governmental organizations. Though some of this criticism is against the WTO generally, many advocates of trade liberalisation also regard TRIPS as poor policy. TRIPS's wealth concentration effects (moving money from people in developing countries to copyright and patent owners in developed countries) and its imposition of artificial scarcity on the citizens of countries that would otherwise have had weaker intellectual property laws, are common bases for such criticisms. Other criticism has focused on the failure of TRIPS to accelerate investment and technology flows to low-income countries, a benefit advanced by. In particular, the illegality of pre-clinical trials or submission of samples for approval until a patent expires have been blamed for driving the growth of a few multinationals, rather than developing country producers.
Although these provisions were in the TRIPS agreement since its inception, nations never interpreted the provisions of the agreement in a manner consistent with the promotion of public health. Certain nations that were subject to the TRIPS agreement would enact legislation that maximized the protection of intellectual property rights but ignored public health crises affecting developing areas. Further and perhaps even more damaging, at the behest of the influential pharmaceutical lobby developed nations would threaten sanctions on countries that attempted to take advantage of parallel importing or compulsory licensing.
For example, in 1997, the United States notoriously threatened trade sanctions against South Africa unless they repealed a section of the Medicines and Related Substances Control Amendment Act, which allowed compulsory licensing and parallel importing, despite it being TRIPS compliant.
